# üåü InsightMate: Your Personal Data Analysis Assistant 

**InsightMate** - an intuitive data analysis tool that helps you explore, visualize, and gain insights from your CSV datasets. With interactive visualizations and the integration of **Google's Gemini**, InsightMate provides instant answers to your dataset-related questions. This tool is designed to make data exploration easy and insightful! üöÄ

## üéØ Goal
The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly application that automates the process of dataset exploration and provides on-demand insights using AI, all through an interactive and visually rich dashboard.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Upload CSV Data**: Start by uploading any CSV file and get a preview of your dataset.
- **Data Cleaning Check**: Automatically checks for missing or inconsistent data.
- **Auto-Generated Dashboard**: Instantly generate distribution plots, bar plots, pie charts, correlation heatmaps, and more.
- **Custom Visualizations**: Create custom visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, line plots, and more using simple dropdowns on the columns of your preference.
- **Dataset Filtering**: Filter data by any column and view detailed exploration of selected columns.
- **Ask AI, Questions**: Interact with **Google‚Äôs Gemini** to ask questions about your dataset and get detailed insights.

## üìö LLMOps with Langsmith

This project integrates **LLMOps** using **Langsmith** for tracing and monitoring AI model performance. By enabling Langsmith tracing, we can:

- **Track AI performance**: Understand how the model is responding to user queries.
- **Monitor latency**: Measure the time it takes for the model to process and return answers.
- **Ensure traceability**: Debug and audit model performance by tracking each invocation and its response.

### Why Langsmith? ü§î

As AI models get more complex, managing their behavior, debugging, and improving efficiency becomes critical. **Langsmith** helps us manage this effectively by:

- Providing **detailed performance metrics** on LLM invocations.
- Allowing us to **track and tune model outputs** over time, ensuring our application delivers accurate insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development of InsightMate

- **Streamlit**: Used to build the web app interface and provide an interactive experience.
- **Pandas**: For loading and manipulating the dataset, and providing data summaries.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: To generate various plots and visualizations of the dataset.
- **Google Gemini AI (via LangChain)**: To provide on-the-fly responses to user queries about their dataset.
- **Langsmith**: To monitor and trace the performance of AI responses and ensure quality results.
